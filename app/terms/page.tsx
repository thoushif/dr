            <h2 className="mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Security</h2> We take
            precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive
            information via the website, your information is protected both
            online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (such
            as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted
            to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed
            lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https"
            at the beginning of the address of the web page. While we use
            encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we
            also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the
            information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or
            customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable
            information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
            identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
            <h2 className="mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Updates</h2> Our
            Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be
            posted on this page.
            <h2 className="mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Cookies</h2>
            We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on
            a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our
            site and identify repeat visitors to our site. Usage of a cookie is
            in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our
            site.
            <h2 className="mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Links</h2>
            This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we
            are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such
            other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our
            site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that
            collects personally identifiable information.

            From time-to-time our site requests information via surveys or
            contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely
            voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and
            therefore disclose this information. Information requested may

            information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.
